# Data-533-Group-16-project
## Description
Our plan is to create a household budgeting tool called `mybudgeter`. 
The program will allow an individual user to set and check budgets for a number of spending categories that they choose.
Users will also have the ability to add, modify, and delete individual transaction, categorize their spending and set a budget for each category. 
If a user's spending is over his/her set budget, the program will alarm the user.
The program will give users the option to create a brand new sqlite database to store their spending and budget data if its the first time using the program or import the data from a sqlite database if its previously created.
User will also have the option to perform basic budget calculation, read or visualize simple budget summary, visualize spending vs. budget trends, set overall savings targets, and get predictions on when they will reach savings targets.
