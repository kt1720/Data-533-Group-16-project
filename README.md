## Description
Our plan is to create a household budgeting CLI program.
The program will allow individual users or households (groups of users) to set and check budgets for a number of transaction categories that they choose. 
Users will also have the ability to add and delete individual transactions, import transactions from a csv, and categorize their transactions. 
If a user adds a transaction that puts them over their set budget, the program will notify the user. 
The program will allow users to import and export previously set budgets so that they do not need to start from scratch each time the program is run.
They will also have the option to visualize spending vs. budget trends, set overall savings targets, and get predictions on when they will reach savings targets.
